# Fedora-Freedom

As you know, Fedora only comes with support for free software by default. So this Project gives you the freedom to install non-free software. 


### By downloading this script, you can install things like:-

- Enabling Flathub

This Project is not associated with [Fedora Project](https://fedoraproject.org/).
