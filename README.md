# Fedora-Freedom

As you know, Fedora only comes with support for free software by default. So this Project gives you the freedom to install non-free software. 


### By Running this script, you can do things like:-

- **Enabling Flathub & removing Fedora flatpak** (As Flathub is superior and fedora's repo only contains a subset of applications available in the flathub repo)
- **Installing RPM Fusion Repo**
- **Installing full version of ffmpeg** (H264 support)
- **Installing Graphics Drivers for Intel/AMD/Nvidia**


This Project is not associated with [Fedora Project](https://fedoraproject.org/).
