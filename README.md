# Fedora-Freedom

As you know, Fedora only comes with support for free software by default. So this Project gives you the freedom to install non-free software. By downloading this script, you can install things like important multimedia codecs for video decoding and even proprietary drivers for NVIDIA GPUs and much more.


This Project is not associated with [Fedora Project](https://fedoraproject.org/).
