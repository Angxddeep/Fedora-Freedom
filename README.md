# Fedora-Freedom

As you know, Fedora only comes with support for free software by default. So this Project gives you the freedom to install non-free software. 


### By downloading this script, you can do things like:-

- **Enabling Flathub & removes Fedora flatpak** (As Flathub is superior and fedora's repo only contains a subset of applications available in the flathub repo )
- **Installing RPM Fusion Repo**
- **Install full version of ffmpeg**
- **Install Graphics Drivers**


This Project is not associated with [Fedora Project](https://fedoraproject.org/).

# 💡 Paste the command below in the terminal 🧑‍💻

bash -c "$(curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Angxddeep/Fedora-Freedom/main/run.sh")"
