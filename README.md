# Fedora-Freedom

As you know, Fedora only comes with support for free software by default. So this Project gives you the freedom to install non-free software. By downloading this script, you can install things like important multimedia codecs for video decoding and even proprietary drivers for NVIDIA GPUs and much more.

## Supports All fedora spins and atomic images too

This Project is not associated with [Fedora Project](https://fedoraproject.org/).
